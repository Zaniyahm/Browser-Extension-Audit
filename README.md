# Browser Extension Audit

## Task Summary
This project involved auditing all installed browser extensions to remove suspicious or unnecessary ones and improve browser security and performance.

## Steps Followed
1. Opened browser extension manager (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Reviewed each installed extension
3. Checked permissions and public reviews
4. Removed unused or suspicious extensions
5. Restarted the browser
6. Researched threats caused by malicious extensions

## Removed Extension
- Adobe Acrobat: PDF edit, convert, sign tools
  (Not actively used, had heavy permissions like "Read your data on all websites")
  
## What I Learned
- Some extensions ask for more access than needed.
- Fewer extensions improve performance and privacy.
- Always verify the purpose and trustworthiness before installing.

## How Malicious Extensions Can Harm
- Steal credentials or personal info
- Inject phishing pages or ads
- Monitor browsing history
- Install other malware
